###  Conclusion :

The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test indicates that the temperature data follows a normal distribution. The p-value is greater than 0.05, which suggests that there is no significant deviation from normality. Thus, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, meaning the temperature data can be assumed to follow a normal distribution.

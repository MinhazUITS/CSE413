## Tasks Completed  
- Generated a 3×3 matrix of random integers between 1 and 50 without setting a seed.  
- Generated a 3×3 matrix of random integers between 1 and 50 using `np.random.seed(10)` for reproducibility.  
- Explained the difference between generating random numbers with and without setting a seed.

## Concepts Covered  
- Using NumPy to generate random matrices and setting a fixed seed.  
- The impact of randomness and reproducibility in simulations.  
- Practical applications of random number generation in real-world contexts.

## What I Learned  
- How to generate and manipulate random matrices using NumPy.  
- The importance of setting a seed to ensure reproducibility in simulations.  
- How controlled randomness can influence data generation and its real-world applications.

## Submission
